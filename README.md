# Python & Cybersecurity Journey 🚀🔐

A learning journey: walking (sometimes crawling) through Python and Cybersecurity

This repository documents my progress as I learn Python from the Udemy 100 Days of Python course and build practical skills through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.  
Here you'll find small projects, code snippets, and blog-style reflections that demonstrate both my coding growth and my developing red-team mindset.
